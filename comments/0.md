# Comments about 0.SHA256 subject

## OpenSSL installation
Maybe leave that to when we are actually use it during the project ?

## SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH
Used everywhere in the subject, but not defined how to get in the subject :
* can be found in `crypto/sha/sha.h` ( openssl )
But do we want them to use OpenSSL directly ? If yes, then the subject should say that the value can be found there. Or at least give an hint where to find it. IE : `You need to find the value of this CONST by yourself, google is your friend`. Or we can directly give it in the subject.

## Missing headers
On Fedora 30 ( don't know which libc they are using ), `uint8_t` is defined in `<stdint.h>`. Not sure about the other distros.
